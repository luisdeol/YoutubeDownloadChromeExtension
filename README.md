# YoutubeDownloadChromeExtension

**Chrome Extension that allows you to download videos from Youtube Channels.**

* Some requirements:
  * YoutubeDownloadAPI running on 127.0.0.1:8000
  * For now, it only allows you to download VISIBLE videos (if you want to download more videos, you need to left-click on "Load more" that sits on the bottom of the videos page) from "/users/{username}"-like urls. I am planning to add single-video download feature soon.
